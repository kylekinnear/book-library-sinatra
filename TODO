    Do we want to be able to import goodreads url/summary/ratings?
      Is this a button that reloads a new view with the fields added?
      Flag book as goodreads_imported to determine which view loads subsequently?

  -We should be able to navigate to Author index pages to see if there are books in the DB that we haven't read as a discovery tool
    -When listing, do we separate out logged_in user books from not? Have no link to non user books, but check for duplicates
      -Checking all books seems pretty computing intensive
      -Is this even an important function?
