This page will always have the book's title
We should be able to find the author from having the author id assigned during creation
User should be able to see the tags they've given the book and add/delete
User should be able to see if they've read it or not
User should see times_read

User should see if they own it
User should be able to set a location
  User may set a location for an unowned book (eg library), but if no location, field will not be displayed outside of editing

User should be able to comment on the book
User should have the option to populate the book with goodreads data, and if they choose to do so, data should be displayed
  A goodreads flag is set when they hit the populate button, data is scraped, page is reloaded
    Data includes a url, rates, and rating

We would prefer to have unpopulated fields on the button under a "you can add this information" heading to avoid whitespace clutter
