If books belong to users, how do we handle multiple users having the same book??
  Is this just a has_many?

line 277 show action spec

Users have many books
Books have
  Title
  Author(s)
  Genre(s)
  Read?
  Times Read
  Owned?
  can have Series

Authors have
  Books
  Series
  Genres
  -We should be able to navigate to Author index pages to see if there are books in the DB that we haven't read as a discovery tool

Genres have
  Books
  -This should also be a page

Series have
  Books
  -Also a page

Editing and deleting books seems like something we don't want becaues of multiple users?
Do we want to create multiple instances of the same book to make more friendly to the individual user?
