Users have many books
Books have
  Title
  Author(s)
  Read?
  Times Read
  Owned?
  can have Series
  Location (where you have it)
  Comments?
  Can have many Tags
    Do we want to be able to import goodreads url/summary/ratings?
      Is this a button that reloads a new view with the fields added?
      Flag book as goodreads_imported to determine which view loads subsequently?

Authors have
  Books
  Series
  -We should be able to navigate to Author index pages to see if there are books in the DB that we haven't read as a discovery tool
    -When listing, do we separate out logged_in user books from not? Have no link to non user books, but check for duplicates
      -Checking all books seems pretty computing intensive
      -Is this even an important function?

Tags-
  Can belong to many Books
  -This should also be a page

Still to do
Authors Controller
Finish books controller (patch route)
Tags controller
Do we want to slug tags?
Test and polish scrape MethodOverride
Show Author
Add tags to create books
Edit book (incl delete book)
Show Book

Testing

Can't reasonably avoid: When you submit a new book, it needs to take the author's slug and find_or_create, but this leaves no way of preserving the actual name you entered
And whoever's book created the author's name is preserved.
  Also seems pretty broken for collaborative works, but we can accept that




Changed book.owned? and book.read? to .owned_flag and .read_flag in books controller, need to follow up elsewhere
