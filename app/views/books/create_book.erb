This is where we create a book
User must enter a title and an author
  We must slug the author and find the correct author id
    Do we want to store what the user gives so we can give it back? What is the author name report hierarchy?

User may enter tags - what is the best way to do multiple tags? Comma separate, make an array, and pull each out?
User may check the read? box. If not, will default to unread
User may tell us how many times the book has been read. If read? is checked, default 1, else default 0
User may tell us if they own the book. Default no
User may tell us where the book is
User will have a field to enter notes/comments on the book
User will be able to check a box to populate from goodreads, default no
