The user navigates here with the author's id or clicking an author name on their library page or an individual book's page
It should first list all of that author's books in the user's library, with links
Can then list books by that author not in the user's library but in other users' libraries
  We need to validate typographical errors so a given book is only listed once (either for originating user or as a discoverable) - downcase, letters only?
    As a bonus, can we sort this by number of users so the most popular is first (do we set up a counter as we validate?)
